# | Percept PC - Unofficial Data Visualiser Application (PUDVA)


## What is this application and why was it developed
This application, called "Percept PC - Unofficial Data Visualiser Application", or in short "PUDVA" (or P.U.D.V.A.) is as it's name says a small, unofficial tool to view the data that the "Medtronic's Percept PC (B35200)" device generates.
Medtronic has it's own official tool, that comes with a mobile device and doctors could use it to analyze the recorded data, however as far as I know, there is no desktop support for that application.

Originally PUDVA has been created, because a friend of a friend of mine has the above mentioned device as a way of treatment, and he wanted to look at the data it generates, but did not know how the do that. As a solution, the predecessor of PUDVA ( a tiny, ugly concept app ) was made by me in early 2021. Later in that same year I rewrote the code completely into what PUDVA is today. The development was free-of-charge, out of will to help him, and possibly his doctors.

Because the application is already been developed, it would be a waste to not share it with others, including the public. The application is entirely free to download and use, and not in any condition you should pay for it. If you have any feedbacks or requests , feel free to contact me in the contact options that are in the application, or at github/twitter. You can find the applications license at the end of this document.
